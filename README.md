The Squire Game System (SGS) is a general-purpose template system to assist with running and playing Tabletop RPGs. It uses a sparse collection of small text files using the JSON file format to allow player to browse and import components into their individual character sheets as needed.

For details and examples of this JSON notation system, please look at the [Examples Directory]()

## Supported Games and Reference Material
While the SGS can be used for any tabletop RPG in existence via the use of creating your own individual component, it is helpful for pre-created components to be generally available. Following the open-source nature of most of the tabletop RPG game systems, RPG Squire makes this component database not only open-source for anyone to view, but also open-source for anyone to submit new content.
