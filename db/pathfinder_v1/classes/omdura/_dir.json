{"name":"Omdura","description":"Omduras’ divine abilities allow them to support their allies with spellcasting and the divine power of their gods. When fighting on their own, they call forth their god’s power to help them defeat their enemies, channeling a god’s divine force into mighty weapons.\n\nAs their powers are influenced by their faith, all omduras must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of omduras revere a specific deity (or multiple deities), a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion-such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge-free of a deific abstraction. (Work with your GM if you prefer this path to selecting a specific deity.)","icon":"holy-symbol","source":"Core Rules","source_url":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/omdura/"}
