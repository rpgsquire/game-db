{"name":"Witch","description":"While many witches are recluses, living on the edge of civilization, some live within society, openly or in hiding. The blend of witchesâ€™ spells makes them adept at filling a number of different roles, from seer to healer, and their hexes grant them a number of abilities that are useful in a fight. Some witches travel about, seeking greater knowledge and better understanding of the mysterious powers that guide them.","icon":"witch-flight","source":"Core Rules","source_url":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch"}
