{"name":"Gunslinger","description":"Gunslingers are thunderous artillery, often found where the fighting is fiercest. Brave, clever, and frequently foolhardy, many gunslingers push to position themselves at close range, barrels blazing, to take down their foes and demoralize their enemies. Other gunslingers are masters of distant death, picking off enemies from afar with their strange and wondrous weapons.","icon":"crossed-pistols","source":"Core Rules","source_url":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger"}
