{"name":"Cleric","description":"More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants. Their true strength lies in their capability to draw upon the power of their deities, whether to increase their own and their allies’ prowess in battle, to vex their foes with divine magic, or to lend healing to companions in need. As their powers are influenced by their faith, all clerics must focus their worship upon a divine source. While the vast majority of clerics revere a specific deity, a small number dedicate themselves to a divine concept worthy of devotion—such as battle, death, justice, or knowledge—free of a deific abstraction.","icon":"holy-hand-grenade","is_enhanced":false,"is_official":false,"timestamps":{"created_t":1658361994,"last_update_t":1658361994},"source":"d20PFSRD","source_url":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/","extra_info":{},"change":{"on_enable":[{"itempath":"class","set_id":"cleric","set_value":{"description":"More than capable of upholding the honor of their deities in battle, clerics often prove stalwart and capable combatants.
