{"name":"Druid","description":"While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.","icon":"holy-oak","source":"Core Rules","source_url":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid"}
