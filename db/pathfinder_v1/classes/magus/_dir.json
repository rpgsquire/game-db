{"name":"Magus","description":"Magi spend much of their time traveling the world, learning whatever martial or arcane secrets they can find. They might spend months learning a new sword-fighting style from a master warrior, while simultaneously moonlighting in the local library, poring through tomes of ancient lore. Most who take this path dabble in all sorts of lore, picking up anything that might aid them in their search for perfection.","icon":"zeus-sword","source":"Core Rules","source_url":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/magus"}
