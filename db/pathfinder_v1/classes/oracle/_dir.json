{"name":"Oracle","description":"Oracles do not usually associate with any one church or temple, instead preferring to strike out on their own, or with a small group of like-minded individuals. Oracles typically use their spells and revelations to further their understanding of their mystery, be it through fighting mighty battles or tending to the poor and sick.","icon":"hand-of-god","source":"Core Rules","source_url":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle"}
