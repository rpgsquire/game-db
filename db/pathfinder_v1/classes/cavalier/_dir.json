{"name":"Cavalier","description":"Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight.

The cavalier is no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most delicate of social situations.","icon":"mounted-knight","source":"Core Rules","source_url":"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/cavalier"}
